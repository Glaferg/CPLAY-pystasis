a thing to help me get some sleep with rainbow leds.


##PYSTASIS: A NAUTILUS HARDWARE PROJECT

This is an attempt to get some sleep and some engineering practice- I'm converting 'dev board' into 'self-made health device'.

This runs on CircuitPlayground Express **NOT TESTED ON BLUEFROOT OR CLASSIC** to see the magic of CircuitPython.

I'm an ambitious person but getting sleep is hard... so I made this.
Press the button and the device will begin subtly counting down 10 minutes until it hits zero and flips off your lamp automagically.
